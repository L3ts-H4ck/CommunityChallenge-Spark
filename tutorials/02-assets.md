  # Make our assets and how to find resources <img src="https://www.enlinealasalle.com/pluginfile.php/8983/course/overviewfiles/vincent-van-gogh-png-2.png" height="25">

## En busca de recursos

First we need to go to [metmuseum.org](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access), where we can find resources from the art collection from "The Met", we can use them, share them and more, without any restriction. This change of policies to Open source, is an important statement from The Met to show their commitment to raise the access to this collection via web.

We're going to the Image of ArtWorks in the Public domain section and click on The Met Collection

Once the page loads, we'll start a search with the name of the artist, the painting, or any other object you want, in this case we search for Van Gogh. I'm going to use the images of this artist to generate my elements.

Once our images are deployed, we're going to click on the one we like the most, we need to make sure it has the Public Domain stamp and we procced to download it by clicking it on the arrow.

We'll have our elements in a folder just to have everything in one place.

## Creando nuestros elementos

We procced to open our image editor and with it, the image we want. Something to keep in mind is that this editor need to be able to select all of our images and crop them, mostly because we want to export them separately

I'm going to select the "quick selection" tool, this tool allow us to separate by colors the image and eliminate the background, before you eliminate it, make sure to duplicate the layer you are working on, you need to have always a backup. Once the copy is made, hide the original to obtain the transparency we're looking for.

In my case I'm going to remove the green background, the pot and the table, leaving only the leaves and flowers.

Once we achive this, I'll export it separately, section by section of flowers and leaves.

For our next element you can access this drive that appers on the comments, in wich you can find templates for your use.

Once inside the drive, we go to the Spark Assets folder.

Inside this folder you can find the following templates.

We'll open the BG template in Photoshop.

We'll open the image we just download from MetMuseum and we crop it.

Once this step is ready, we need to paste our image in BG and adjust it until we like the result.

On the next tutorial, we'll learn how to use our assets inside a Facebook or Instagram filter.
